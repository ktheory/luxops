## Discovery
During this portion of the post-mortem session, our goal is to discover the facts of the incident. Use the questions below as a guide to understanding the events as they happened. The discovery should be posed in a timeline format.

* What actions did everyone take, and when?
* What did everyone observe as the incident progressed?
* How was the incident managed?
  * How was the incident discovered?
  * Who discovered it?
  * How did they escalate it?
  * Did our monitoring processes work as intended?
  * Did we have all the tools necessary to troubleshoot the problem quickly?
* What were the root causes of the incident? Keep in mind that there is rarely just a single cause.
* How was the issue resolved?
* How was the incident communicated to stakeholders/customers? (Status blog, email, etc)

## Retrospective
The second part of the post-mortem session is to consider what we can learn from this incident.

* What were the biggest pain points in handling this incident?
* Did anything cause a delay in resolution that could have been avoided?
* Did we follow any false leads? Why did that happen?
* Based on what we have learned about the cause of the incident, what steps can we take to avoid this kind of issue in the future?
* Can we improve our monitoring processes to catch this type of incident in the future?
* Can we improve our ability to troubleshoot this type of incident? How?
* What other parts of the Incident Response process could we improve?
* How could we improve communication within our team, and with stakeholders/customers?

It’s important to note that this process is blameless. We aren’t interested in finding anyone to discipline or point fingers at; this is an opportunity for us to learn and improve our team and our business!
